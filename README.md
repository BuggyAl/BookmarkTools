# **SchoolTools**

A collection of JavaScript bookmarks to assist you in class.

*JavaScript MUST be enabled in your browser for this to work!*

## **Usage**

In order to use these quick functions, you will need to create a **bookmark** to run the JavaScript in your browser. In order to properly use these functions:

- Create a new bookmark
- Edit the **URL** of the bookmark to: ```javascript:PASTE_CODE_HERE```

- Run the bookmark and enjoy!

Alternatively, you can also run this in through the **search bar** by typing in the URL above into the bar!

*Automatic bookmarks will be coming eventually!*
