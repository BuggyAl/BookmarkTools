# **BookmarkTools**

A collection of JavaScript bookmarks to assist you in everyday life.

*JavaScript MUST be enabled in your browser for this to work!*

## **Usage**

In order to use these quick functions, you will need to create a **bookmark** to run the JavaScript in your browser. In order to properly use these functions:

1. Navigate to the file of your choice and copy the javascipt "fetch" code at the top of the file.
2. Create a new bookmark
3. Edit the **URL** of the bookmark to: ```javascript:PASTE_CODE_HERE```
4. Run the bookmark and enjoy!

Alternatively, you can also run this in through the **search bar** by typing in the URL above into the bar!

- As of March 29, 2022, all code has fetch requests at the top for people to use instead of the code itself.
